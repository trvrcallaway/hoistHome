                <p>You’re scanning through Twitter, and you see an interesting headline - “7 Ways to Improve (insert desired result).” Perfect. This established company would definitely have some useful tips for your fledgeling marketing career. You click the link and prepare for awesomeness. “Before you learn about the 7 ways, please fill out this brief nine question form, and receive the free resource!” Seriously? I travelled across the interwebs for a crappy opt-in? Exit page — find gif to describe my displeasure.</p>

                <p>This anecdote describes many of our experiences. You’ve been promised a valuable resource, and then bombarded with a Soviet Union-intensity-level signup form. Everything from an email address, to a phone number. Maybe a blood type? It was “free,” but we knew going into it that we would have to give something. Normally an email address suffices, but there comes a point where I feel like I’m signing up for a dating service.</p>
                <p>We all know how it works: You give something (email address), you get something free (eBook, email course, etc.) But sometimes, it just gets ridiculous. If you don’t want to give away a lot of content, I totally understand. We are all trying to make a living, but don’t pose as the Good Samaritan if you’re planning on spamming me for the next decade. Promise a free resource, provide a free resource with minimal strings attached.</p>
                <p>Promising a free “Complete Guide to the World’s Greatest Meatloaf,” and then asking for my mailing address, work position, and pet’s middle name is just going to cause frustration. Especially if you’ve promised the resource within an apparent “no strings attached” context. Who doesn’t want to make the world’s greatest meatloaf?</p>
                <p>The numbers don’t lie when it comes to consumers getting fed up with lengthy signup forms. <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31517/12-Ways-to-Create-a-User-Friendly-Website-Registration-Process.aspx">This post by Corey Eridon,</a> cites an eMarketer report that suggested 88% of people have either left a field blank, or given false information when signing up through a form. She then goes on to say, “Whether it’s due to privacy concerns or frustration, online shoppers have higher standards than ever before for a sleek and simple registration process.”</p>
                <p>If you do choose to go the FBI background check signup form route, your content needs to be awesome. Someone who hangs around long enough to fill out sixteen boxes worth of information is expecting to be blown away by the content their receiving in exchange.</p>
                <p>You want to know a better way to get email addresses? A better way to get people to opt-in for your newsletter? Provide A TON of free stuff. Good stuff. Don’t just skimp on what you give away for free — put your money where your mouth is and give your readers your best. This establishes trust. Trust means that you build a following that will eventually take on a bigger commitment like a <a href="http://www.jeffbullas.com/2015/03/18/how-to-increase-your-email-signups-by-over-600-using-this-cool-tactic/">Content Upgrade, which Tim Soulo talks more about in this post.</a></p>
                <p>Have you ever been to a career fair? Which table was cooler? The one that gave you a ton of boring paperwork (ins and outs of the job, starting pay, etc.), or the one that handed out koozies with the paperwork? KOOZIES. YES. The people weren’t just there to hand out the boilerplate documents that they had to hand out, they also wanted you to take something with you that would remind you of them. They wanted to leave a lasting impression. Are you leaving a lasting <strong>impression</strong> on the people who follow your brand, or are you just keeping score of email signups?</p>
                <p>In my opinion, the less demanding you look, the better. If a user feels pressured to opt-in, or doesn’t want to divulge a lot of information, they’re either going to bounce or just provide you with a bunch of false information (as the <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31517/12-Ways-to-Create-a-User-Friendly-Website-Registration-Process.aspx">Eridon post</a> suggested). How useful is that? Rather, you should just focus on getting SOMETHING, even if it’s only an email address.</p>
                <p>The hardcore business guy would probably speak against offering a lot of free content, but the hardcore business guy also wants to spam your phone with solicitations. People dig generosity way more than sharpness. Obviously there is a lot of bad free content out there, but there is just as much that’s amazing.</p>
                <p>It’s the internet, people. The content you’re offering behind your 10 section opt-in form can probably be found way easier somewhere else.</p>
                <p>So it’s obvious that your focus should be on the value of the content you offer. If you start there, you’ll be able to eventually monetize it because users will be interested in what you’re offering, and also interested in supporting you.</p>
                <p>Let’s pretend that they did sign up for your fancy pants PDF. What now? Show your subscribers some love! They put in the work, filled out all of the required fields, and now they should not only get your resource, but a thank you. You should also consider giving them more than what they asked for. Simply getting a signup does not guarantee long term engagement. Instigator Blog talks about the role of long-term engagement in the onboarding process, and it’s definitely worth a read.</p>
                <p>You also have the responsibility to not spam your subscribers with “sales” emails. Having their email address, and using it wisely are two completely different things. It’s clear that they want to hear from you, but they probably only want to hear about things that pertain to the topic that they signed up for.</p>
                <p>If you offer content on multiple topics, consider dividing the email lists up into what topic the subscriber originally signed up for. This will show the customer that you’re considerate of their interests, and it could go a long way in keeping your unsubscribes down.</p>
                <p>There are no silver bullets to creating the perfect signup form, but there are things that can make your process seem obnoxious to users. If you’re offering valuable content for free, make sure you offer it for FREE. If you want to collect information from your users, make it a simple (voluntary) process. Provide value, and watch your subscriptions increase.</p>
